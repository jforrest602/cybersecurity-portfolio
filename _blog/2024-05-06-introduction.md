### *"Since making up my mind up to study in earnest, I have taken as my teacher everything in the universe, as well as the examples set by my predecessors. I am still in the process of learning." - Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645)*

I have embarked on a path that has already proven to be more difficult and more humbling than I anticipated. Recently, I quit my safe job working as an administrator at a small private university in Rhode Island and moved to a foreign country with my family. I have chosen to use my time here to try and learn new skills in information technology and cybersecurity in hopes of turning the page on my previous career and launching a new one. It is my intention with this blog to take any readers along with me as trudge through the processes of reskilling and searching for new job opportunities.      

People rightfully want to know, why cybersecurity? A quick Google or YouTube search will turn up loads of information about the industry and it's future. Jump down that rabbit hole if you're interested. For me personally, it's about developing a passion, finding a new way to positively impact the world, and continuing to learn and find ways to become better. It's much less about the promises of six figure salaries made by modern day snake oil salesmen. Of course a fat paycheck would be nice, but I know I'm not anywhere near that point in the game.
