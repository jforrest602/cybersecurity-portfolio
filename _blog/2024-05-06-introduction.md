I have embarked on a path that has proven to be more difficult and more humbling than I anticipated. I quit a safe job  as an administrator at a small private university in Rhode Island and moved my family to a foreign land. Unable to speak the local language with any degree of competence, I'm  left with very few options in terms of employment. I can teach English. It is something I have experience doing but also something that I'm only qualified to do by the circustamces of my birth. I could also spend hours commuting each day to a low-skill, low-wage job at a factory, hotel, or construction site. Both options provide little in terms of career mobility and the second option would leave me with too little time with my young family. Instead, I have chosen to use my time here to try and learn new skills in information technology and cybersecurity in hopes of turning the page on my previous career and launching something new. It is my intention with this blog to take any readers along with me as I trudge through the processes of reskilling and searching for new job opportunities.      

People rightfully want to know, why cybersecurity? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the number of Information Security Analysts working in the U.S. at 170,000 and expects that number to increase 32% by 2032. In other words, there is a growing demand for knowledgable cybersecurity professionals. A quick Google or YouTube search will turn up loads of information about the current state of the industry and it's expected future. Jump down that rabbit hole if you're interested. For me personally, it's about traveling a path that allows me to develop a passion, do some good in the world, and continue to grow and never stop learning. I'm not so naive as to expect a six figure salary with no experience. A promise made by many modern day snake oil salesmen make all over YouTube. I know I don't yet have the technical chops to demand such a thing but, it would be disingenious to myself and you the reader if I said I didn't consider it at all. It's absolutely something that I am aiming for once I have 5, 10, 15 years of experience under my belt. Right now, the goal is to get my foot in the door with an entry level position and I know that probably means I'll be taking a pay cut from my previous position. I'm OK with that.   

### *"Since making up my mind up to study in earnest, I have taken as my teacher everything in the universe, as well as the examples set by my predecessors. I am still in the process of learning." - Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645)*  

My path into this IT and cybersecurity learning journey has been circuitous. As a young man, I was not interested in learning. Rebellious would be a kind way to describe me at that time. In hindsight, an angry and lost child is more appropriate. College wasn't on my radar even though the people around me always encouraged it. Many years later, I did complete a four-year degree and eventually a Master's degree, both in unrelated fields. Upon graduation, I siezed an opportunity to travel to the Far East where I believe my real education began. For the first time I stepped outside of my comfort zone and began to expand the boundaries of it. It was thrilling. It showed my that learning and growth can come to you in many forms if you open up and allow it in.  

My time overseas eventually ended and I took a job in international education at that university in Rhode Island. There I had many wonderful opportunities to work with incredible people and do and see things that I would have never experienced otherwise. The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed the landscape of international education and many of the opportunities to be impactful in the lives of students and faculty disipated. I became jaded and knew it was time to move on to something else.  

In early 2023, I was once again in the Far East. This time with a family to support and limited career options. Wanting to build a career and not just work low-skill jobs, I thought long and hard about what to do next. Perhaps to my own detrement, I have alwys been too adverse to risk to try and start my own business. I knew that I wanted to do something that I could become passionate about and something that provided potential for growth. Cybersecurity, something that always piqued my interests, felt like it met both of those requirements. Then, on May 4th, 2023 Google announced the release of a new professional certificate in cybersecurity. If I was going to attempt this, the time was now.

I have always been skeptical of technology and the promises of convenience that come along with its development. It intrigues me how so many people are constantly integrating new apps and technologies into their daily lives, unquestioning of what they are giving up in return. Awareness around cyber hygiene is getting better but I believe there is still much to accomplish in terms of educating the general user. Defending and educating the average user is where I believe my passion currently lies within the cybersecurity field. In particular, active defense is an area which I plan to explore more. I won't know this for sure until I gain much more hands-on experience but I look forward to eventually delving deeper into threat intelligence, intrusion detection, incident response, honeypots, and other aspects of active defense. 

So far on this journey, I have completed the Google Cybersecurity professional certificate and several smaller, online training programs. I am active on several cybersecurity related Discord servers. I attended the local BSides conference and have gone to two locally hosted 2600 meetups. I have met several seasoned experts of their respective fields that have been, at face value, supportive of my desire to enter into cybersecurity. It has also been incredibly humbling. Often times I am older than the experts I meet who already have a decade or more of experience doing something that they love. It is intimidating and has on several occassions left me doubting myself and questioning whether or not I have made the right decision. However, I also like to believe that I have the ability to do difficult things, even if I don't want to. If you're a fan of the Huberman Podcast, you may have heard Professor Huberman discuss the emerging data around the brain area called the anterior midcingulate cortex, which grows when people engage in activities that they don't want to do or overcome challenges, and that the size of this anterior midcingulate cortex may be related to longevity. I try to remember this when I am doubting myself. I know that I can overcome the gaps in knowledge and become a competent cybersecurity professional. It will take grit and there will be ups and downs along the way. If i can remember these things and remind myself that I am not going to give up, I will accomplish this goal.    

I have set a date to take the Comptia Security+ exam which is best described as an well-known and recognized entry-level industry certification. I will write more about that exam and my preparation for it in the next post.
