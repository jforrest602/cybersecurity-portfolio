If you're looking to pivot your career into cybersecurity like me, then it's likely you will need to gain one or more industry recognized certications to help you get noticed by HR or recruiters. These certifications will be especially important if, like me, you do not have any formal technical education. These certifications are by no means any gaurantee that you will receive job offers but, from my understanding, they will at the least help get your resume past the initial screening process and in front of a human. An important caveat, I am wiriting this before I have earned my first cybersecurity certification or even landed any interviews. It is my intention to share with the reader what I have learned about industry certifications so far, and what I have been doing to prepare to take the Comptia Security+ SY0-701 exam in a few short weeks.   

The cybersecurity industry relies heavily on certifications. This may be because for a long time colleges and universities weren't offering security focused degrees. Degree programs have traditionally been more broadly focused on computer science or information technology. Either will provide you with a solid foundation for a career in cybersecurity but, neither focus exclusively on the skills needed to become a security expert. That has begun to change. For example, Western Governors University offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance which is endorsed by both the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense. Students in that program graduate with no less than 15 industry certifications, including the Comptia Security+, CySA+, and PenTest+ to name a few. You will undoubtedly become more familiar with these certifications the more time you spend learning and engaging with the community.   

I would like to enroll in the Western Governors University program because I think that the outcomes would be incredibly beneficial as I'm trying to break into the field, it's 100% online, can be completed at your own pace, and it can be an cost-effective way to earn a degree. It's my feeling that having the 15 certifications will go a long way in at least getting you an interview for the job. However, due to personal circumstances at the time of writing, I am not eligible to enroll.  If it sounds like an interesting program to you, I encourage you to check out their website and YouTube for the many videos reviewing the program.   

The certifications that I have mentioned so far are all offered by CompTIA, or the Computing Technology Industry Association. Considered one of the IT industry's leading trade organizations, it offers many widely recognized certifications in IT fundamentals, networking, security, and cloud computing among other things. I have chosen the Sscurity+ as my first certification because it demonstrates that one has the core skills to perform fundamental security functions like assess the security posture of an organization and implement appropriate security solutions, monitor and secure hybrid environments, and identify, analyze and respond to security incidents and events. It was also strongly recommended throughout the Google Cybersecurity program. Those who complete the Google certificate receive a 30% discount code for the exam.

By no means is CompTIA the only player in the game. The cybersecurity certification idustry is growing. In 2022, the size of the market was estimated at USD 4.1 billion and is projected to grow to nearly USD 20 billion by 2032. Other reputable organizations that offer training and certifcations include ISC2, a member association for cybersecurity professionals which offers at least 9 different certifications ranging from beginner to advanced some with specific elibility requirements. The SANS Institute is known for offering some of the highest quality education and training accompanied by covented certifications that very few individuals can afford to pay for out of pocket. If you're lucky enough to find an employer who will sponsor you SANS education and GIAC certifcation, go for it. TryHackMe is an online platform that offers a kind of suscription-based model where users can complete their certifications at their own pace. Of course, Microsoft, Amazon, and other technology companies offer training and certifcations in specific technologies. All of these organizations offer resources to help prepare you to earn that first or next certification. The point is, there is no shortage of educational opportunities and certifcations for someone to choose from and it can be very confusing for someone new to the field.    

How do you choose the right certifcation? Not an easy question to answer. It ultimately comes down to your individual goals and circumstance. Are you aiming to be part of the blue team, red team, or somewhere in the middle? What kind of technichal knowledge and experience do you already have? If you're already working in IT or cybersecurity, what kind of new skills do you want to aquire? What sort of time and financial resources are at your disposal? These are all questions that you must consider when deciding which certification is right for you. If you're still not sure after answering these questions, go to YouTube, Reddit, or Discord and find out more from people with first hand experience.   

A word of caution, be skeptical of anyone on those platforms selling course or bootcamps that promise or garauntee you a job after completion. Their products may actually be good but, as I have learned recently, some of the best in the industry share their knowledge for free as a way to help others and give back to the community. Antisyphin Training aims to provide education to everyone regardless of their financial position with their pay-what-you-can training courses. The Hack Smarter community offers pay-what-you-can career coaching, something that I am taking advantage of. The knowledge is out there for you to grab if you want it. You will spend enough money on certification exams so, be cautious when spending money on training and education and make sure to rely on those people and organizations with reputable track records.  

I am taking the the CompTIA Security+ exam in just under one week's time from now. I chose this as my first certification for several reasons including there being no prerequisites to sit for it, it being an "entry-level" certification that is widely recognized and even required for many postions in government or contracting with the government, and the way Google promoted it during that certificate program. Luckily, for myself and anyone out there planning to sit for it, there are plenty of resources, free and paid, to help prepare you to pass the exam.     

First and foremost, you need to watch Proffessor Messer's CompTIA SY0-701 Security+ Training Course on YouTube. It's a free, comprehensive video series that breaks down each exam objective into easily digestible chunks for the learner. I paired this video series with the official CompTIA Security+ Self-Paced Study Guide. I would read about a topic in the book, digest it, and watch the corresponding Professor Messer video(s). Read, watch, repeat. Another great resource from Professor Messer are his monthly interactive study sessions. He covers several sample questions each month and breaks down the answers for you. Those sessions are also posted to YouTube, which I watch because I can skip over the non-exam-related content and drill down on what's most important to me. Another helpful YouTube channel and Discord server is Slay Security+. There are similar open study sessions for anyone to join.

This becomes a big challenge for someone like myself who is trying get a foot in the door on my own. I don't have a formal education in computer science or IT. I haven't been fascinated by computers or dreamt of being a hacker since I was a child. I don't have anyone guiding me along, although I hope this changes soon.
