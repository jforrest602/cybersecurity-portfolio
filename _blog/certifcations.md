If you're looking to pivot your career into cybersecurity like me, then it's likely you will need to gain one or more industry recognized certications to help you land that first cybersecurity job. These certifications will be especially important if, like me, you do not have any formal technical education. These certifications are by no means any gaurantee that you will receive job offers but, from my understanding, they will at the least help get your resume past the initial screening process and in front of a human. An important caviet here is that I am wiriting this before I am earned my first cybersecurity certification or received any job offers. It is my intention to share with the reader what I have learned about industry certifications so far and what I have been doing to prepare to take the Comptia Security+ SY0-701 exam in a few short weeks.   

The cybersecurity industry relies heavily on certifications. This may be because for a long time colleges and universities weren't offering degrees exclusively in the field. In terms of degree programs, choices were computer science or information technology. Either will provide you with a solid foundation for a career in cybersecurity but neither focus exclusively on the skills needed to become an expert. Nowadays, that is changing. Western Governors University, for example, offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance endorsed by the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense. Graduates will leave that program with 15 industry certifications. I would enroll in that online program immedeately if my current circumstances were a bit different. I'm not eligible to enroll in the online program because I am currently residing outside of the U.S. and not on a U.S. military base. It's 100% online and can be completed at your own pace. If that sounds like an interesting program to you, I encourage you to check out their website and YouTube for the many videos reviewing the program.   

The cybersecurity certification idustry is growing. In 2022, the size of the market was estimated at USD 4.1 billion and is projected to grow to nearly USD 20 billion by 2032. This becomes a big challenge for someone like myself who is trying get a foot in the door on my own. I don't have a formal education in computer science or IT. I haven't been fascinated by computers or dreamt of being a hacker since I was a child. I don't have anyone guiding me along, although I hope this changes soon.
