If you're looking to pivot your career into cybersecurity like me, then it's likely you will need to gain one or more industry recognized certications to help you get noticed by HR or recruiters. These certifications will be especially important if, like me, you do not have any formal technical education. These certifications are by no means any gaurantee that you will receive job offers but, from my understanding, they will at the least help get your resume past the initial screening process and in front of a human. An important caveat, I am wiriting this before I have earned my first cybersecurity certification or even landed any interviews. It is my intention to share with the reader what I have learned about industry certifications so far, and what I have been doing to prepare to take the Comptia Security+ SY0-701 exam in a few short weeks.   

The cybersecurity industry relies heavily on certifications. This may be because for a long time colleges and universities weren't offering security focused degrees. Degree programs have traditionally been more broadly focused on computer science or information technology. Either will provide you with a solid foundation for a career in cybersecurity but, neither focus exclusively on the skills needed to become a security expert. That has begun to change. For example, Western Governors University offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance which is endorsed by both the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense. Students in that program graduate with no less than 15 industry certifications, including the Comptia Security+, CySA+, and PenTest+ to name a few. You will undoubtedly become more familiar with these certifications the more time you spend learning and engaging with the community.   

I would like to enroll in the Western Governors University program because I think that the outcomes would be incredibly beneficial as I'm trying to break into the field, it's 100% online, can be completed at your own pace, and it can be an cost-effective way to earn a degree. It's my feeling that having the 15 certifications will go a long way in at least getting you an interview for the job. However, due to personal circumstances at the time of writing, I am not eligible to enroll.  If it sounds like an interesting program to you, I encourage you to check out their website and YouTube for the many videos reviewing the program.   

The certifications that I have mentioned so far are all offered by CompTIA, or the Computing Technology Industry Association. Considered one of the IT industry's leading trade organizations, it offers many widely recognized certifications in IT fundamentals, networking, security, and cloud computing among other things. I have chosen the Sscurity+ as my first certification because it demonstrates that one has the core skills to perform fundamental security functions like assess the security posture of an organization and implement appropriate security solutions, monitor and secure hybrid environments, and identify, analyze and respond to security incidents and events. It was also strongly recommended throughout the Google Cybersecurity program. Those who complete the Google certificate receive a 30% discount code for the exam.

By no means is CompTIA the only player in the game. The cybersecurity certification idustry is growing. In 2022, the size of the market was estimated at USD 4.1 billion and is projected to grow to nearly USD 20 billion by 2032.   



This becomes a big challenge for someone like myself who is trying get a foot in the door on my own. I don't have a formal education in computer science or IT. I haven't been fascinated by computers or dreamt of being a hacker since I was a child. I don't have anyone guiding me along, although I hope this changes soon.
