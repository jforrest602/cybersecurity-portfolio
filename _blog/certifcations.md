   If you're looking to pivot your career into cybersecurity like me, then it's likely you will need to gain one or more industry recognized certications to help you land that first cybersecurity job. These certifications will be especially important if, like me, you do not have any formal technical education. These certifications are by no means any gaurantee that you will receive job offers but, from my understanding, they will at the least help get your resume past the initial screening process and in front of a human. An important caviet here is that I am wiriting this before I am earned my first cybersecurity certification or received any job offers. It is my intention to share with the reader what I have learned about industry certifications so far and what I have been doing to prepare to take the Comptia Security+ SY0-701 exam in a few short weeks. 

The cybersecurity industry relies heavily on certifications.
